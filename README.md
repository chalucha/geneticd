geneticd
========

Simple Genetic Algorithm Library for D.

Note: 
>Curently even simplest evaluation is not possible because of unimplemented core genetic operators, etc. - WIP<

First target is single threaded evaluation with posibility to use custom genes, fitness functions, terminate functions, selection functions, mutation operators, etc.
Then some samples should be provided with some benchmarks and optimisations.
After that parallel processing will be implemented.
Then?
 - distributed evaluation
 - genetic programming


TODO: Add commented sample to show how to use it
TODO: Add to dub packages and add reference here
